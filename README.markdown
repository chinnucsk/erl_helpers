# erl_helpers

It's a set of Erlang "helper" modules, nothing any more.

## Install

Inside "deps" directory of your OTP application, for example:

    $ git clone git@github.com:leandrosilva/erl_helpers.git
    $ cd erl_helpers
    $ make ungit
    $ make

And finally, put it in the code path of your application and enjoy it.

## 3rd party modules

These modules __mochijason2__ and __struct__ weren't built by me. However I added three new functions in __struct__: from_json/1, from_json/2, to_json/1.
